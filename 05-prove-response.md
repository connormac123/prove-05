**Question 1:**  From Part 1, how did you answer the interview question for the Set Operations problem (should be no more than 30 seconds if spoken aloud)?
Since the purpose of the union is to return all common items in both sets into a new one I would either use the intersection the
& function as both functions are effective and preform at an 0(1) on average time complexity. 



**Question 2:**  From Part 2, how did you answer the interview question for the Find Pairs problem (should be no more than 30 seconds if spoken aloud)?

I would first intialize a set to keep of words encountered
iterate through each word on the list. 
For each word I would reverse to find any symmetric pairs.
Check if reversed words exist in a set.
If yes we pound a symmetric pair, we can display that
if not return word to list 
Continue for all words.
